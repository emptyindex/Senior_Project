These options include Start Game, Quit, Instructions, Credits, and Toggle Sound. If player chooses Start Game whoever is chosen to go first with start. Player can move with the mouse where the chess piece is legal to move via rules. WASD can be used to rotate the camera view. Esc key can be used to bring up a pause menu. The game would continue until either player or AI wins the match and the player is showed an end screen of whether to restart, go to main menu, show move counter, or quit.
